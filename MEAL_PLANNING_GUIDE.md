  - 7 days √ó 4 meals (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack)
  - Each meal includes: name, calories, protein, carbs, fat, ingredients, cost, prep time
- No timeout - waits for full Ollama response generation
- Calculates daily/weekly nutrition totals automatically

**Post-Generation:**
- Plan populates 7-day grid with meal cards

---

### 5. ‚ú® AI Insight & Feedback
**Location:** Floating card (bottom-right) + detailed modal

**Floating Insight Card:**

    - üü° Yellow: 60-79% (good)
    - üî¥ Red: <60% (needs improvement)
  - Brief summary (e.g., "Avg 1800 kcal/day, 90g protein")
- "Optimize Plan" button opens detailed modal
- Auto-hides after 10 seconds (click to dismiss early)
- Reappears on plan changes

**AI Insight Modal:**
- Click "Optimize Plan" or "View Insights" button
- Backend calls `/api/meal-plan/insights` with full plan + profile
- Ollama analyzes plan and generates:
  - **Alignment Score:** Big visual with percentage
  - **Overview:** 2-3 sentence analysis of plan quality
  - **3 Optimization Suggestions:** Each with:
    - Type: Swap, Add, or Remove
    - Target meal (e.g., "Day 2 Lunch")
    - Alternative meal with full macros
    - Reason (e.g., "Swap pasta for quinoa: Saves $5, +5g protein üí™")
  - "Apply" button on each suggestion
- Applies suggestions directly to plan (instant update)
- Gamification: +points for applied suggestions toward badges

**Alignment Calculation:**
- Compares avg daily calories/protein to goal targets:
  - Weight Loss: 1600 kcal, 100g protein
  - Muscle Gain: 2500 kcal, 150g protein
  - Maintenance: 2000 kcal, 80g protein
- Formula: `100 - (|actual - target| / target √ó 100)`
- Capped at 0-100 range

## Known Limitations & Future Enhancements

### Current Limitations
1. **OCR Accuracy:** Tesseract may struggle with cursive handwriting or low-quality images
2. **Ollama Response Time:** Can take 10-30 seconds for complex plan generation (no spinner timeout)
3. **Recipe Database:** Currently uses 8 hardcoded sample recipes (should integrate with USDA database)
4. **Pantry Items:** Not yet persistent (stored in component state, lost on refresh)
5. **Meal History:** No tracking of past plans or favorites

### Planned Enhancements
- **Integration with USDA Database:** Use 2000+ foods from existing ML pipeline
- **Recipe Photos:** Thumbnail images for visual appeal
- **Nutritional Breakdown Charts:** Pie charts for macro distribution
- **Meal Prep Mode:** Tag recipes as "batch-friendly" with quantity multipliers
- **Grocery Store API:** Real-time pricing from Instacart/Walmart
- **Voice Input:** "Alexa, add salmon to my meal plan"
- **Social Sharing:** Share plans to community, upvote popular plans
- **Meal Plan Templates:** Pre-made plans for common goals (Keto, Mediterranean, Vegan)
- **Adaptive Learning:** Track which meals user actually ate, improve suggestions
- **Multi-Week Planning:** Extend beyond 7 days to monthly plans

## Support & Troubleshooting

### Issue: Plan generation fails with timeout
**Solution:** Increase `num_predict` in controller or ensure Ollama is running

### Issue: OCR extracts gibberish
**Solution:** Use higher quality images with clear, printed text

### Issue: Drag-and-drop not working
**Solution:** Check console for DndKit errors, ensure plan state is initialized

### Issue: Shopping list missing ingredients
**Solution:** Verify meal plan has ingredients array populated

---

## Conclusion
All 5 feature sets are fully implemented and integrated. The system provides a complete meal planning experience with AI assistance, manual flexibility, visual interactions, smart insights, and comprehensive exports. No timeouts ensure Ollama can generate complete responses. Test the flows end-to-end with the provided checklist.
