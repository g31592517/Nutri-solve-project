## 🎓 Learning Points

### Technical Decisions

**Why localStorage?**
- Fast prototyping
- No backend required
- User-specific data isolation
- Easy migration to backend later

**Why Context API?**
- No external state library needed
- Type-safe with TypeScript
- Prevents prop drilling
- Easy to test and maintain

**Why Separate Contexts?**
- UserProfile: Authentication-dependent, profile data
- Gamification: Heavy logic, frequent updates
- Prevents unnecessary re-renders

**Why localStorage Keys Include User ID?**
- Multi-user support
- Data isolation
- Prevents conflicts
- Easy to clear per user
